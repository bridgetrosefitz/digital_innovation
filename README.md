## Why I made it

This app is a platform to compare digital innovation in different countries. It provides initial thinking and dynamic metrics about factors which lead to innovative digital products being created in a country, such as the amount of activity on GitHub, and the availability of capital.

In future, the site could crowdsource ideas and data about what makes a ripe environment for digital innovation (indicators about mindset, access to tech education, the price of a computer, who knows!), with the goal of helping people in tech connect and travel to places where they can contribute to innovative projects.

This project was inspired by a research paper completed during my Masters.

### User Stories

I kept myself organized with user stories, available [here](https://bridgetrosefitz.notion.site/Bridget-Fitzgerald-Digital-Innovation-0c0a03caf93f4643bfa85f634bd0d8ae).


## What's next

The app is currently an MVP with full CRUD of projects and tasks, and the ability to flag tasks. From here, I'd like to make it more user-ready. Major next-up priorities (as of 07/27/21) are:
* Implement the other ideas under the "Nice to have" category in my [user stories](https://bridgetrosefitz.notion.site/Bridget-Fitzgerald-Digital-Innovation-0c0a03caf93f4643bfa85f634bd0d8ae)
